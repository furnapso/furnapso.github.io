        <div class="text-sm">A dynamic and results-oriented Senior Software Engineer with a proven track record
          of driving
          innovation and delivering high-quality solutions in fast-paced environments. I excel in leveraging
          cutting-edge
          technologies to streamline processes and enhance overall efficiency.<br/><br/>

          Currently, as a Senior Software Engineer at Flight Centre Travel Group, I utilize my expertise in Java,
          Spring and Vue.js to build robust, scalable enterprise software
          to meet the ever-changing needs of the travel industry.<br/><br/>

          I am passionate about software engineering as a craft and take pride in the work that I do. As a
          self-taught
          software engineer, I am a zealous reader and learner and am always on the lookout for ways to upgrade my
          skills.<br/><br/>

          Outside of work, if I'm not working on a personal project, you can find me bush walking in the Gold Coast
          hinterland, at home watching movies and reading books, or dancing the night away at a live gig.
